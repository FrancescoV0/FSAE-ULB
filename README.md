# FSAE-ULB
## TO-DO list:
- Simulink model:
    - [ ] Add limits to the gimball joint
    - [x] Create a system to get the speed, camber, and slip ancle of each wheel
    - [x] Add the influence of camber inside the Magic formula block
    - [x] Set correctly the point of application of the downforces
    - [x] Add the aerodynamic drag directly to the chassis?
    - [x] Refine the formula to calculatye the speed of the car
    - [x] Set correctly the new aerodynamic coefficients to take into account the presence of the wheels
    - [x] Add a spring + damper system

- OpenFOAM simulation:
    - [x] Add the wheels to the geometry
    - [x] BC of the street (same velocity as Uâˆž)
    - [x] BC on the wheel
