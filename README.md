# FSAE-ULB
## TO-DO list:
- Simulink model:
    - [x] Add limits to the gimball joint
    - [x] Create a system to get the speed, camber, and slip ancle of each wheel
    - [x] Add the influence of camber inside the Magic formula block
    - [x] Set correctly the point of application of the downforces
    - [x] Add the aerodynamic drag directly to the chassis?
    - [x] Refine the formula to calculatye the speed of the car
    - [x] Set correctly the new aerodynamic coefficients to take into account the presence of the wheels
    - [x] Add a spring + damper system
    - [x] Resolve the conflict error
    - [ ] Connect the steering wheel and the pedals


- OpenFOAM simulation:

    - [x] BC of the street (same velocity as Uâˆž)
    - [x] BC on the wheel

- SpeedGoat:
    - [ ] Find the signal that creates the overflow
