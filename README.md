# FSAE-ULB
## TO-DO list:
- Simulink model:
    - [ ] Add limits to the gimball joint
    - [ ] Create a system to get the speed, camber, and slip ancle of each wheel
    -  [ ] Add the influence of camber inside the Magic formula block
    - [ ] Set correctly the point of application of the downforce
    - [ ] Add the aerodynamic drag directly to the chassi?
    - [ ] Refine the formula to calculatye the speed of the car
    - [ ] Set correctly the new aerodynamic coefficients to take into account the presence of the wheels

- OpenFOAM simulation:
    - [ ] Add the wheels to the geometry
    - [ ] BC of the street (same velocity as Uâˆž)
    - [ ] BC on the wheel
